## PHISHING-WEBSITE-DETECTION-BY-MACHINE-LEARNING-TECHNIQUES
To develop a new machine learning algorithm to detect and classify phishing websites. Phishing is the most commonly used social engineering and cyber attack.

#### Objective 
A phishing website is a common social engineering method that mimics  trustful uniform resource locators (URLs) and webpages. The objective of this project is to develop a new machine learning algorithm to classify phishing websites. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites  are gathered to form a dataset and from them required URL and website  content-based features are extracted. 

#### Existing System 
Currently there are many systems which use Machine Learning algorithms like Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest etc. to detect phishing websites
There are also systems which compare these algorithms and give the most efficient one as a result.
However, none of these algorithms is entirely accurate and efficient. 
There are also several research papers which use many techniques like white-list, black-list, content-based, URL-based, visual-similarity etc. to detect phishing websites.
To add to this, there are several websites to which focus on phishing sites and help warn users against the same. 

#### Proposed System 
Most machine learning algorithms currently being used to classify phishing websites are old and not entirely accurate and efficient.
We aim to implement a new machine learning algorithm which is efficient and easy to use and detects phishing websites with high accuracy.
Phishing websites are one of the most common attacks aimed at users. Hence its very important to detect them and avoid/eliminate them. Thus, our project will be of huge help.

#### Modules
The project is split into 5 modules they are : 
Module 1 - Data Collection and Data Cleaning 
Collection of dataset from Kaggle and data cleaning to remove unwanted values which might affect the prediction 
Module 2 - Data Analysis 
Graphs and charts are plotted to understand the pattern of the dataset and the relationships between data elements
Module 3 -  Data preprocessing 
The parameters which are used to predict the phishing urls are identified and then the dataset is split into training and testing datasets 
Module 4 - Model Training 
Development and Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithm 
Module 5 -  Performance and accuracy prediction 
Analysis of results and further work to improve performance of algorithm 

#### Alogrithms used 
- AdaBoost 
- Multi Layer Perceptron classifier
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
- Kernel approximation classification
